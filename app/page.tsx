        Hi, I&apos;m <span className="font-semibold">Zack</span>, a Software
        Engineer building out my ideas. Currently a SWE undergrad student at
        McMaster University. I love solving challenging problems and I&apos;m
        fascinated with innovations in AI and technology.

        On days when I decide I&apos;ve had enough of staring into a monitor, I
        enjoy going out for a hike or at least doing something active. I&apos;m
        always on the lookout for new things to learn and food to eat!

        I will be joining Capital One as a Software Engineer after graduating.
