Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'll be writing about interesting technical challenges I've faced (and how I've solved them), new advances in machine learning and technology, and things I find cool.

The goal of starting this blog is to encourage myself to actively learn about new developments in technology and AI (mostly through reading research papers and playing around with open-source code). With all the buzz around LLMs recently, I will be sharing my thoughts on recent papers on this topic (and others) and I hope to gain a better understanding of the algorithms behind them. I would also love to share development work when building a new project and the technical intricacies that come with it.
